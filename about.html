    <h2>about this project</h2>
    <p>
      Baseball lies not only in its timeless traditions but also continuously
      evolves and improves. The sport's Hall of Fame, a shrine of its
      most excellent players, managers, and icons in the sport, has remained a
      cherished, yet complex, tradition. My master's thesis sought to modernize
      the evaluation process by introducing a data-driven approach that
      centralizes four advanced statistical metrics: <b>Offensive Wins Above
      Replacement (oWAR), Defensive Wins Above Replacement (dWAR), Weighted On-Base
      Average (w/OBA), and Weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+)</b>. This study
      challenges conventional notions of Hall of Fame candidacy that have for years
      relied on outdated and flawed statistics. This research aims to represent a more
      data-informed Hall of Fame selection process for future candidates.

    <h2>methodology</h2>
    <p>
      The approach for creating the quantifiable measurement for a given Hall of Famer
      and Hall of Fame candidate is straightforward. The grade \( G \) for a player is a sum
      of products, where each product is career statistic multiplied by a decimal weight
      that represents its importance in relation to the overall grade. The following
      equation describes how this project's Hall of Fame grade \( G \) is calculated:

      <div class="formula">
        $$ G = (oWAR \times 0.4) + (dWAR \times 0.3) + (\text{w/OBA} \times 0.15) + (wRC+ \times 0.15) $$
      </div>

      Using the Hall of Fame grade \( G \), two additional calculations
      are performed to determine the final probability that a given candidate will be successfully
      elected to the Hall of Fame: the difference \( D \) between the candidate's grade \( G \) 
      and the average grade \( \mu(G_H) \) of an elected hall of famer at the candidate's respective
      primary position, and the percentile rank \( P \) of the candidate's grade \( G \) among a sorted
      list of grades \( G \) for all elected hall of famers at the player's respective position.

      Using these two additional calculations, a probability table is consulted to outline the chances a
      candidate has of being successfully elected:

      <div class="custom-table-container">
        <table class="custom-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th>\( G \geq \mu(G_H) - 2 \)</th>
              <th>\( G \geq \mu(G_H) - 3 \)</th>
              <th>\( G \geq \mu(G_H) - 5 \)</th>
              <th>\( G \geq \mu(G_H) - 7 \)</th>
              <th>\( G \geq \mu(G_H) - 9 \)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>\( \gt \) 45th percentile</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #ffd666;">\( 80\% \)</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #ffdf85;">\( 65\% \)</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #ffe7a4;">\( 50\% \)</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #ffefc2;">\( 35\% \)</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #fff7e1;">\( 20\% \)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>\( \leq \) 45th percentile</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #ffdf85;">\( 65\% \)</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #ffe7a4;">\( 50\% \)</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #ffefc2;">\( 35\% \)</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #fff7e1;">\( 20\% \)</td>
              <td style="color: black; background-color: #ffff;">\( 5\% \)</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      This table attempts to answer two questions: 1) Is the candidate being evaluated at least nine points
      below, or at around 20% of the average hall of famers' grade at his primary position? and 2) Does the
      candidate rank among the current list of elected hall of famers at his position in at least the 45th
      percentile?<br><br>
      The table above was validated with the voting results of the 2023 Hall of Fame ballot.

    <h2>the statistics</h2>
    <h3>oWAR</h3>
    <p>
      Offensive Wins Above Replacement (oWAR) is a comprehensive measure of a position player's
      offensive contributions. Wins Above Replacement (WAR) fundamentally quantifies a player's
      value compared to a hypothetical "replacement" player, accounting for multiple offensive
      facets of the game. In the context of oWAR, the emphasis is solely on a player's offensive impact,
      making it a valuable tool for evaluating batting performance. The calculation of oWAR is based on
      constructing an average value derived from various player performances across the league. This average
      forms the baseline for comparison - hence, the name, “replacement player.” The oWAR of a player is
      determined by contrasting their offensive contributions to this league-wide average and calculating
      the resulting surplus. The higher this surplus, the more above-average a player is compared to the
      rest of the league. When summed over a player's entire career, it becomes measurable how much more
      (or less) valuable a player is compared to his counterparts.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>dWAR</h3>
    <p>
      Defensive Wins Above Replacement (dWAR) is a specialized metric focused solely on quantifying a player's
      defensive contributions, considering both defensive statistics while also adjusting for the position played.
      In contrast to oWAR, dWAR zeros in on the player's fielding performance, providing insights into their ability
      to prevent runs through defensive excellence. But, like oWAR, a vital component of this calculation is the
      establishment of a “replacement-level” player for defense, which corresponds to a league average. dWAR gauges
      how much better a player's defensive contributions are compared to a hypothetical replacement player. This
      statistic also creates a single value that encompasses a number of different defensive measurements which
      enables a standardized comparison across both different positions and different eras.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>w/OBA</h3>
    <p>
      Weighted On-Base Average (w/OBA) is an evolved version of the traditional On-Base Percentage (OBP) statistic,
      introducing a dynamic evaluation of a player's ability to reach base and contribute to their team's offensive
      performance. Unlike OBP, which treats all methods of reaching base equally, w/OBA assigns different values to
      each offensive event based on its potential to influence the scoring of runs. The calculation of w/OBA
      involves assigning distinct weights to various offensive events based on their projected impact on runs scored.
      For instance, a home run is weighted more heavily than a single, which reflects its capacity to generate a
      greater number of runs. These weighted values are then aggregated to produce the player's w/OBA, encapsulating
      their ability to create scoring opportunities. The following formula describes how w/OBA is calculated for a
      given player, taken from
      <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/weighted-on-base-average">Major League Baseball's
        official glossary</a>:
      <div class="formula">
        $$
        \text{w/OBA} = \frac{
        (\text{uBB}_{\text{f}} \times \text{uBB}) +
        (\text{HBP}_{\text{f}} \times \text{HBP}) +
        (1\text{B}_{\text{f}} \times 1\text{B}) +
        (2\text{B}_{\text{f}} \times 2\text{B}) +
        (3\text{B}_{\text{f}} \times 3\text{B}) +
        (\text{HR}_{\text{f}} \times \text{HR})
        }{
        (\text{AB} + \text{BB} + \text{SF} + \text{HBP})
        }
        $$
      </div>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>wRC+</h3>
    <p>
      Weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+), similar to w/OBA, is a comprehensive measure of a player's offensive
      contributions, quantifying their ability to generate runs through a combination of on-base skills and power
      hitting. The statistic takes into account both a player's ability to reach base as well as their proficiency
      in producing extra-base hits, which offers a holistic understanding of their offensive impact.
    <div class="formula">
      $$
      \text{wRC+} = (\frac{
      (\text{wRAA per PA} + \text{league runs per PA}) +
      (\text{league runs per PA} - \text{ballpark factor} \times \text{league runs per PA})
      }{
      (\text{league wRC per PA})
      }) \times 100
      $$
    </div>
    <br>
    The formula above, taken from
    <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/weighted-runs-created-plus">Major League Baseball's
      official glossary,</a>
    describes the process for calculating a player's wRC+. It encapsulates a player's ability to reach base and
    produce extra-base hits divided by their total opportunities at the plate. What sets wRC+ apart from many
    other traditional offensive statistics, however, is its normalization, which ensures that the league average
    is always established at 100. This feature eliminates the influence of external factors, such as the ballpark
    played in or the historical era, enabling direct comparisons across players and time periods. A ballpark that
    is notoriously difficult to hit in, like Oracle Park in San Francisco, California, is adjusted in order to
    measure the same as a ballpark that is very friendly to hitters, like Great American Ballpark, located in
    Cincinnati, Ohio. The interpretation of wRC+ is also relatively simple to understand. A wRC+ of 150 denotes
    that the player is performing 50% better than the league average, and any wRC+ below 100 denotes a player
    who is performing below the league average.<br><br>
    A statistic like wRC+ is especially useful for this model because we are comparing players from different
    ballparks and from different time periods. wRC+ introduces an element of normalization that enables the equitable
    evaluation of players from unequal eras, accounting for the variations in offensive conditions and ballpark
    dimensions. It does a particularly good job of eliminating external factors, facilitating a balanced assessment
    of a player's offensive prowess and ensuring that the performance of a player is evaluated within the context of
    the broader baseball landscape.
