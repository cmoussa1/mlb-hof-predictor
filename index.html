    <h2>about this project</h2>
    <p>
      Baseball lies not only in its timeless traditions but also continuously
      evolves and improves. The sport's Hall of Fame, a shrine of its
      most excellent players, managers, and icons in the sport, has remained a
      cherished, yet complex, tradition. My master's thesis sought to modernize
      the evaluation process by introducing a data-driven approach that
      centralizes four advanced statistical metrics: <b>Offensive Wins Above
        Replacement (oWAR), Defensive Wins Above Replacement (dWAR),
        Weighted On-Base Average (w/OBA), and Weighted Runs Created Plus
        (wRC+)</b>. This study challenges conventional notions of Hall of Fame
      candidacy that have for years relied on outdated and flawed statistics.
      Through statistical analysis, I look to uncover intriguing insights based
      on data aggregation of the current body of Hall of Fame position players,
      build a predictive model for current Hall of Fame candidates, and analyze
      past elections of rejected Hall of Fame candidates. This research aims to
      represent a progressive step toward more transparent, inclusive, and
      data-informed Hall of Fame selection processes for future candidates. By
      embracing modern statistical analysis and an open discourse about
      position-specific standards, this research aims to preserve the Hall of
      Fame's status as a shrine to excellence while at the same time introducing
      new ways to look at contemporary players and make decisive and objective
      comparisons to those considered the greatest to ever walk on the field. As
      the complexities of Hall of Fame induction are navigated, this research
      hopes to serve as a testament to the enduring spirit of baseball—an
      endeavor where both numbers and narratives converge to honor those who
      have left an unforgettable mark on the sport.

    <h2>methodology</h2>
    <p>
      The approach for creating the quantifiable measurement for a given Hall of Famer
      and Hall of Fame candidate is straightforward. The grade <i>G</i> for a player is a sum
      of products, where each product is career statistic multiplied by a decimal weight
      that represents its importance in relation to the overall grade. The following
      equation describes how this project's Hall of Fame grade <i>G</i> is calculated:

      <div class="formula">
        $$ G = (oWAR \times 0.4) + (dWAR \times 0.3) + (\text{w/OBA} \times 0.15) + (wRC+ \times 0.15) $$

    <h2>the statistics</h2>
    <h3>oWAR</h3>
    <p>
      Offensive Wins Above Replacement (oWAR) is a comprehensive measure of a position player's
      offensive contributions. Wins Above Replacement (WAR) fundamentally quantifies a player's
      value compared to a hypothetical "replacement" player, accounting for multiple offensive
      facets of the game. In the context of oWAR, the emphasis is solely on a player's offensive impact,
      making it a valuable tool for evaluating batting performance. The calculation of oWAR is based on
      constructing an average value derived from various player performances across the league. This average
      forms the baseline for comparison - hence, the name, “replacement player.” The oWAR of a player is
      determined by contrasting their offensive contributions to this league-wide average and calculating
      the resulting surplus. The higher this surplus, the more above-average a player is compared to the
      rest of the league. When summed over a player's entire career, it becomes measurable how much more
      (or less) valuable a player is compared to his counterparts.
    </p>
    <h3>dWAR</h3>
    <p>
      Defensive Wins Above Replacement (dWAR) is a specialized metric focused solely on quantifying a player's
      defensive contributions, considering both defensive statistics while also adjusting for the position played.
      In contrast to oWAR, dWAR zeros in on the player's fielding performance, providing insights into their ability
      to prevent runs through defensive excellence. But, like oWAR, a vital component of this calculation is the
      establishment of a “replacement-level” player for defense, which corresponds to a league average. dWAR gauges
      how much better a player's defensive contributions are compared to a hypothetical replacement player. This
      statistic also creates a single value that encompasses a number of different defensive measurements which
      enables a standardized comparison across both different positions and different eras.
    </p>
    <h3>w/OBA</h3>
    <p>
      Weighted On-Base Average (w/OBA) is an evolved version of the traditional On-Base Percentage (OBP) statistic,
      introducing a dynamic evaluation of a player's ability to reach base and contribute to their team's offensive
      performance. Unlike OBP, which treats all methods of reaching base equally, w/OBA assigns different values to
      each offensive event based on its potential to influence the scoring of runs. The calculation of w/OBA
      involves assigning distinct weights to various offensive events based on their projected impact on runs scored.
      For instance, a home run is weighted more heavily than a single, which reflects its capacity to generate a
      greater number of runs. These weighted values are then aggregated to produce the player's w/OBA, encapsulating
      their ability to create scoring opportunities. The following formula describes how w/OBA is calculated for a
      given player, taken from
      <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/weighted-on-base-average">Major League Baseball's
        official glossary</a>:
      <div class="formula">
        $$
        \text{wOBA} = \frac{
        (\text{uBB}_{\text{f}} \times \text{uBB}) +
        (\text{HBP}_{\text{f}} \times \text{HBP}) +
        (1\text{B}_{\text{f}} \times 1\text{B}) +
        (2\text{B}_{\text{f}} \times 2\text{B}) +
        (3\text{B}_{\text{f}} \times 3\text{B}) +
        (\text{HR}_{\text{f}} \times \text{HR})
        }{
        (\text{AB} + \text{BB} + \text{SF} + \text{HBP})
        }
