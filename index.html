    <h2>about this project</h2>
    <p>
      Baseball lies not only in its timeless traditions but also continuously
      evolves and improves. The sport's Hall of Fame, a shrine of its
      most excellent players, managers, and icons in the sport, has remained a
      cherished, yet complex, tradition. My master's thesis sought to modernize
      the evaluation process by introducing a data-driven approach that
      centralizes four advanced statistical metrics: <b>Offensive Wins Above
        Replacement (oWAR), Defensive Wins Above Replacement (dWAR),
        Weighted On-Base Average (w/OBA), and Weighted Runs Created Plus
        (wRC+)</b>. This study challenges conventional notions of Hall of Fame
      candidacy that have for years relied on outdated and flawed statistics.
      Through statistical analysis, I look to uncover intriguing insights based
      on data aggregation of the current body of Hall of Fame position players,
      build a predictive model for current Hall of Fame candidates, and analyze
      past elections of rejected Hall of Fame candidates. This research aims to
      represent a progressive step toward more transparent, inclusive, and
      data-informed Hall of Fame selection processes for future candidates. By
      embracing modern statistical analysis and an open discourse about
      position-specific standards, this research aims to preserve the Hall of
      Fame's status as a shrine to excellence while at the same time introducing
      new ways to look at contemporary players and make decisive and objective
      comparisons to those considered the greatest to ever walk on the field. As
      the complexities of Hall of Fame induction are navigated, this research
      hopes to serve as a testament to the enduring spirit of baseballâ€”an
      endeavor where both numbers and narratives converge to honor those who
      have left an unforgettable mark on the sport.

    <h2>methodology</h2>
    <p>
      The approach for creating the quantifiable measurement for a given Hall of Famer
      and Hall of Fame candidate is straightforward. The grade <i>G</i> for a player is a sum
      of products, where each product is career statistic multiplied by a decimal weight
      that represents its importance in relation to the overall grade. The following
      equation describes how this project's Hall of Fame grade <i>G</i> is calculated:

      <div class="formula">
        $$ G = (oWAR \times 0.4) + (dWAR \times 0.3) + (\text{w/OBA} \times 0.15) + (wRC+ \times 0.15) $$
